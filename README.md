# Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient searching algorithm suitable for sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found.

# Steps:
1.Start with the entire sorted list.<br>
2.Compute the middle element of the list.<br>
3.If the middle element is equal to the target value, return its index.<br>
4.If the middle element is less than the target value, search in the right half of the list.<br>
5.If the middle element is greater than the target value, search in the left half of the list.<br>
6.Repeat steps 2-5 until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.

# Linear Search
Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. It sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the target value.

# Steps:
1.Start from the first element of the list.<br>
2.Compare each element of the list with the target value.<br>
3.If the element matches the target value, return its index.<br>
4.If the target value is not found after iterating through the entire list, return -1.
